<p>You don’t need to use Visual Studio to write game code in Unreal. You can generate a solution file, crack it open, and start writing code. That’s the officially supported workflow, and it’s a perfectly valid approach. It’s great for beginners since it’s an easy way to get started. However, I’ve found it also leads a lot of people to miss out on an opportunity to form an understanding of how an Unreal project fits together and how the build system works, and let’s face it, the Visual Studio experience is not everybody’s cup of tea.</p>
<p><img src="./resources/visual-studio-experience.png" alt="Visual Studio Experience" /></p>
<p>Within this document I will show you how you can create an Unreal project from scratch with just a text editor. I will explain how we can build and run that project from the command line. After going through this document I hope that you get a basic understanding on what happens when you build an Unreal project. If down the line you are ever faced with a wall of cryptic error messages, you’ll have a better idea of how to diagnose the problem and get moving again.</p>
<p>But first let us <a href="./development_setup.html">setup the environment</a> I use to work within Unreal.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="development-tools"><a class="header" href="#development-tools">Development Tools</a></h1>
<p>Before we dive into the exciting world of game engines and compilers, let's talk about two essential tools every developer needs: a trusty text editor and a reliable terminal. And guess what? With VS Code, you get both bundled in one neat package! Now, I know there are alternatives out there like Sublime Text and Cmder, but for this walkthrough, I'll be sticking with VS Code—it's my go-to choice when working with Unreal Engine.</p>
<h3 id="why-vs-code-you-ask"><a class="header" href="#why-vs-code-you-ask">Why VS Code, you ask?</a></h3>
<p>Let me break it down for you. VS Code doesn't clutter your workspace, it's highly customizable to match your preferences, packed with awesome features, and incredibly lightweight and responsive. Even when dealing with massive codebases like Unreal, it won't drag you down.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-visual-studio"><a class="header" href="#what-about-visual-studio">What about Visual Studio?</a></h3>
<p>Unreal Engine is designed to integrate smoothly with Visual Studio, allowing you to make code changes in your projects “quickly” and &quot;easily&quot;, and “immediately” see results upon compilation but it's essential to understand that for Unreal, it serves primarily as a frontend. Unreal doesn't utilize the Visual Studio “toolset” directly for building; instead, it relies on a batch script that invokes builds for your target platform. However, the Visual Studio installation comes with certain features that are required to invoke builds (on Windows) so in order to use VS Code we have to go through the process of installing Visual Studio.</p>
<h2 id="installing-vs-code"><a class="header" href="#installing-vs-code">Installing VS Code</a></h2>
<p><img src="./resources/download-vs-code.png" alt="Download Visual Studio Code" /></p>
<p>Here's how to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Head over to the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">official VS Code website</a> and download the installer.</li>
<li>Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.</li>
<li>Once installed, let's beef up the IDE with some essential extensions:
<ul>
<li>C++ IntelliSense: Your coding buddy that provides smart suggestions and auto-completions.</li>
<li>Visual Studio Keymaps: For those familiar shortcuts to keep your workflow smooth.</li>
<li>Tasks: We'll get into this later.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make your life easier by setting up Unreal snippets in VS Code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grab or clone the <a href="https://github.com/Dyronix/unreal-snippets-vscode">Unreal Snippets repository</a> onto your machine.</li>
<li>Navigate to <code>%APPDATA%/Code/User/snippets</code>.</li>
<li>Paste the repository contents (excluding the .git folder) into this directory.</li>
<li>Restart VS Code (if it's open) to apply the changes. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="optional-vs-code---theme"><a class="header" href="#optional-vs-code---theme">[Optional] VS Code - Theme</a></h3>
<p>Add a touch of personality to your coding environment for extra cuteness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize your VS Code with a sleek theme like Dracula.</li>
<li>Enhance it further with vscode-icons for some visual flair.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./resources/dracula-code-extension.png" alt="Dracula - VS Code Extension" />

<p>For seamless integration, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Start menu and search for &quot;environment variables.&quot;</li>
<li>Access the &quot;Edit the system environment variables&quot; dialog.</li>
<li>In the environment variables section, edit the PATH variable.</li>
<li>Add the path to your VS Code installation directory (typically located at 
<ul>
<li><code>C:\Users\${username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open the Task Manager and restart Explorer.exe to finalize the changes (this will refresh everything related to Windows Explorer).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./resources/edit-environment-variables.png" alt="Edit Environment Variables" /></p>
<p>Equipped with these essential tools, you're primed to traverse the intricacies of game development using VS Code. With precision and proficiency, let us embark on this journey into the realm of coding excellence.</p>
<h2 id="installing-visual-studio"><a class="header" href="#installing-visual-studio">Installing Visual Studio</a></h2>
<p><img src="./resources/download-visual-studio-installer.png" alt="Download Visual Studio Installer" /></p>
<p>When it comes to installing Visual Studio, it's not as straightforward as opting for the latest version. Unreal Engine has specific requirements regarding the version of Visual Studio and its components. To determine the compatible version, you'll need to consult the <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/unreal-engine-5.0-release-notes/">release notes</a> corresponding to your chosen version of Unreal Engine. For instance, if you're using Unreal Engine 5.0, refer to the release notes and navigate to the &quot;Build farm&quot; section to identify the officially supported version.</p>
<p><img src="./resources/unreal-engine-build-farm-output.png" alt="Unreal Engine Release Notes - Build Farm" /></p>
<p>While it's not mandatory to install the exact version specified in the release notes, it's advisable for team collaboration and to minimize potential build issues. However, if you already have a newer version installed, downgrading isn't necessary, but keep in mind potential compatibility issues.</p>
<p>To install Visual Studio, download the installer from the <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">official website</a> and run it. The Visual Studio Installer allows you to select and install various components, including the Visual C++ toolset, debugger, runtime SDKs, and more. Additionally, I recommend installing the .NET workload, as many external tools used within Unreal Engine are written in C#. This ensures compatibility and provides flexibility if you ever need to build these tools from source.</p>
<p><img src="./resources/desktop-development-with-cpp.png" alt="Desktop Development With C++" />
<img src="./resources/net-desktop-development.png" alt=".NET Desktop Development" /></p>
<p>Before proceeding to the <a href="./creating_unreal_project_from_scratch.html">next section</a>, verify that the versions of Visual Studio, .NET package, and Windows SDK match the requirements specified in the Unreal release notes. This meticulous approach ensures a smooth development experience and minimizes compatibility hurdles down the line.
For more information about setting up Visual Studio and some additional tips and tricks on how to modify Visual Studio as an IDE, you can visit the official documentation of Unreal: <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/VisualStudioSetup/">Unreal Engine: Visual Studio Setup</a></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="creating-an-unreal-project-from-scratch"><a class="header" href="#creating-an-unreal-project-from-scratch">Creating an Unreal Project from Scratch</a></h1>
<p>Let's peek behind the scenes to understand how project files and build processes interconnect. Instead of diving straight into the complexities, let me guide you through setting up a new project in Unreal Engine from scratch.</p>
<p>Begin by carving out a cozy space for your project on your disk drive. When it comes to naming your project, simplicity reigns supreme. This name isn't etched in stone as part of your public-facing brand—it merely serves as a convenient identifier. A short codename suffices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up a folder where we'll work our magic.</li>
<li>Give your project a name.
<ul>
<li>Again, keep it simple, nothing too crazy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We're gonna start with a .uproject file to lay down the basics and we'll need a Source folder for all our C++ goodness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drop a .uproject file in the main folder.</li>
<li>Make a Source folder in there too.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./resources/starting-pos-unreal-project-from-scratch.png" alt="Starting Position Unreal Project From Scratch" /></p>
<h2 id="the-uproject-file"><a class="header" href="#the-uproject-file">The .uproject File</a></h2>
<p>A .uproject file, short for &quot;Unreal Project File,&quot; serves as the entry point and configuration file for an Unreal Engine project. It's a JSON-formatted file that contains essential information about the project, such as its name, description, and the list of modules and/or plugins it uses. An Unreal Project File is recognized by the UnrealVersionSelector, this setting is stored in the your registry by Unreal when you installed it. The following attributes can be found within a .uproject file:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>FileVersion</strong></td><td>Descriptor version number.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>EngineAssociation</strong></td><td>Specifies the engine to open the project with. <br> Allows for opening the correct engine version when double-clicking on a project file. <br> Differentiates between editor versions for upgrade/downgrade UI flow. <br> For Launcher users, it indicates a stable version like &quot;5.0&quot; or &quot;5.1&quot;. <br> For Perforce or Git users, it's left blank, allowing determination of the engine based on the directory hierarchy. <br> For source build users with a foreign project, uses a random identifier for engine mapping. <br> For users with the engine mounted through a Git submodule, can be manually edited as a relative path.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Category</strong></td><td>Category to show under the project browser.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Description</strong></td><td>Description to show in the project browser.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Modules</strong></td><td>List of all modules associated with this project.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Plugins</strong></td><td>List of plugins for this project, which may be enabled or disabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>TargetPlatforms</strong></td><td>Array of platforms that this project is targeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>EpicSampleNameHash</strong></td><td>A hash used to determine if the project was forked from a sample.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>PreBuildSteps</strong></td><td>Custom steps to execute before building targets in this project.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>PostBuildSteps</strong></td><td>Custom steps to execute after building targets in this project.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Enterprise</strong></td><td>Indicates if this project is an Enterprise project.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>DisableEnginePluginsByDefault</strong></td><td>Indicates that enabled by default engine plugins should not be enabled unless explicitly enabled by the project or target files.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><em>Note:</em></p>
<p><em>When project file association is not working properly one can simply run <strong>UnrealVersionSelector.exe -fileassociations</strong> from the Unreal Engine Binaries.</em>
<em>You could refer to the following files for proper debugging capabilities.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/release/Engine/Source/Programs/UnrealVersionSelector/Private/UnrealVersionSelector.cpp#L40">UnrealVersionSelector.cpp</a></em></li>

<p>When the project file is loaded into memory it is stored within a <code>FProjectDescriptor</code> which contains all the information contained within a .uproject file. Each .uproject file when containing source files is accompanied with a list of modules and/or plugins available to the project. Modules have their own set of attributes as specification when and how they should be loaded by the engine, all information is stored within a structure called <code>FModuleDescriptor</code>. The following attributes can be found within a module definition:</p>

<h3 id="plugins"><a class="header" href="#plugins">Plugins</a></h3>
<p>Last architectural piece of the Unreal Engine are plugins, due to the complexity of UE plugins I will not go into full detail here rather give you a brief overview of what they are and how to use them. </p>
<p>Plugins are collections of code and data that developers can easily enable or disable within the Editor on a per-project basis. Plugins can add runtime gameplay functionality, modify built-in Engine features (or add new ones), create new file types, and extend the capabilities of the Editor with new menus, tool bar commands, and sub-modes. Many existing UE4 subsystems were designed to be extensible using plugins.</p>
<p>The main difference between modules and plugins is that plugins (usually) will contain one or more modules, and can also optionally contain their own content. So in a sense they’re a higher level construct than a module. You can see them as a sub-project within your main project so to speak. Each plugin if they have source code will have their own Source folder, with the accompanied Binaries folder that contains the compiled code for that plugin. They can have their own Content folder that contains Assets specific for that Plugin. </p>
<p>Last I'll leave you with an overview of some of the more common attributes of a Plugin that you need to be aware of, this data is stored in a structure called <code>FPluginDescriptor</code>, you'll notice that they are quite similar to the ones of an Unreal Project:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>FileVersion</strong></td><td>Descriptor version number.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Version</strong></td><td>Version number for the plugin. The version number must increase with every version of the plugin, so that the system can determine whether one version of a plugin is newer than another, or to enforce other requirements. This version number is not displayed in front-facing UI. Use the VersionName for that.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>VersionName</strong></td><td>Name of the version for this plugin. This is the front-facing part of the version number. It doesn't need to match the version number numerically, but should be updated when the version number is increased accordingly.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>FriendlyName</strong></td><td>Friendly name of the plugin.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Description</strong></td><td>Description of the plugin.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Category</strong></td><td>The name of the category this plugin.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>DocsURL</strong></td><td>Documentation URL string.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>MarketplaceURL</strong></td><td>Marketplace URL for this plugin. This URL will be embedded into projects that enable this plugin, so we can redirect to the marketplace if a user doesn't have it installed.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SupportURL</strong></td><td>Support URL/email for this plugin.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>EngineVersion</strong></td><td>Version of the engine that this plugin is compatible with.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>EnabledByDefault</strong></td><td>Whether this plugin should be enabled by default for all projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>CanContainContent</strong></td><td>Can this plugin contain content?</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>IsBetaVersion</strong></td><td>Marks the plugin as beta in the UI.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Installed</strong></td><td>Signifies that the plugin was installed on top of the engine.</td></tr>

<h2 id="build-targets"><a class="header" href="#build-targets">Build Targets</a></h2>
<p>Now that the initial setup for our project is setup we have to move on to Build Targets. We first require a Target Rules Definition file. It will tell the Unreal build system how to build our project. Supported target types are as followed:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Game</strong></td><td>A standalone game which requires cooked data to run.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Client</strong></td><td>Same as Game, but does not include any server code. Useful for networked games.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Server</strong></td><td>Same as Game, but does not include any client code. Useful for dedicated servers in networked games.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Editor</strong></td><td>A target which extends the Unreal Editor.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Program</strong></td><td>A standalone utility program built on top of the Unreal Engine.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Targets are declared through C# source files with a .target.cs extension, and are stored under your project's Source directory. Each .target.cs file declares a class deriving from the <a href="https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/release/Engine/Source/Programs/UnrealBuildTool/Configuration/TargetRules.cs">TargetRules</a> base class, and sets properties controlling how it should be built from its constructor. When asked to build a target, UnrealBuildTool will compile your target.cs file and construct the class inside it to determine its settings.</p>
<p>The <strong>name of the class must match the name of the file</strong> it's declared in <strong>followed by 'Target'</strong> (so for example, Patrol.target.cs defines the class 'PatrolTarget'). They typical structure of a target file is as followed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Csharp">using UnrealBuildTool;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class PatrolTarget : TargetRules
{
    public PatrolTarget(TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
    {
        Type = TargetType.Game;

        // Other properties go here
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Numerous properties are accessible from the base class, the details of which are too extensive to cover within this page. For a comprehensive list of all available properties, I recommend consulting the <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/BuildTools/UnrealBuildTool/TargetFiles/">Official Unreal Documentation</a> or examining the <a href="https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/release/Engine/Source/Programs/UnrealBuildTool/Configuration/TargetRules.cs">Source Code</a> (Regrettably, not all properties are exhaustively described within the documentation.). However, I'd like to direct your attention to two properties that may prove particularly useful.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DefaultBuildSettings</strong> Specifies the engine version to maintain backwards-compatible default build settings with (eg. DefaultSettingsVersion.Release_4_23, DefaultSettingsVersion.Release_4_24). Specify DefaultSettingsVersion.Latest to always use defaults for the current engine version, at the risk of introducing build errors while upgrading.</li>
<li><strong>ExtraModuleNames</strong> List of additional modules to be compiled into the target.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="populating-the-target-rules"><a class="header" href="#populating-the-target-rules">Populating the Target Rules</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned the Target Rule Definitions need to be stored under your project's Source directory. So let's do that now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to your Source directory</li>
<li>Create a new Target Rules file
<ul>
<li>{projectname}{modulename}.Target.cs</li>
<li>We can use the snippet <strong>umt</strong> to autocomplete this file</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./resources/game-target-rules-definition.png" alt="Game Target Rules Definition" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to your Source directory again</li>
<li>Create a new Target Rules file
<ul>
<li>{projectname}{modulename}Editor.Target.cs</li>
<li>We can use the snippet <strong>umt</strong> to autocomplete this file</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change the Target Type within this Editor Target Rules file to &quot;Editor&quot; instead of &quot;Game&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it for the creation of our project, in the <a href="./setup_unreal_project_from_scratch.html">next section</a> we will discuss how we can setup our Unreal Project properly by adding source code and Build Rule Definition files. Within this section we learned that the .uproject file tells Unreal Editor that it can open this directory as an Unreal Project using the specified version. It also specifies that when the Editor opens this project, it should find and load the DLL for the module called &quot;PatrolCore&quot;. The .Target.cs file tells the Unreal Build System that it can build all the necessary code for this project by building the &quot;PatrolCore&quot; module. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="setup-an-unreal-project-from-scratch"><a class="header" href="#setup-an-unreal-project-from-scratch">Setup an Unreal Project from Scratch</a></h1>
<p>In the <a href="./creating_unreal_project_from_scratch.html">previous section</a> we delved into the essence of a .uproject file and its interaction with the modules and plugins defined within your project. Additionally, we explored Target Rule Definitions, which outline the specifications for building a project. With the project now established, let's proceed to incorporate some source code for the module we've created. By now, you've likely recognized the common convention in Unreal Engine to organize a module's source code into Public and Private subdirectories. The Public directory houses headers that necessitate visibility to other modules, while the Private directory encompasses all implementation details specific to this module.</p>
<p>Let's start by doing that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to your Source/{projectname}{modulename} directory</li>
<li>Add a Private directory</li>
<li>Add a Public directory</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./resources/adding-public-private-directory.png" alt="Adding Public and Private source directories" /></p>
<h2 id="module-build-rules"><a class="header" href="#module-build-rules">Module Build Rules</a></h2>
<p>Before we add any source code we will need an additional C# file, namly the Module Build Rules. Modules are the building blocks of UE4. The engine is implemented as a large collection of modules, and games supply their own modules to augment them. Each module encapsulates a set of functionality, and can provide a public interface and compile environment (with macros, include paths, and so on) for use by other modules. Modules are declared through C# source files with a .build.cs extension, and are stored under your project's Source directory. The C++ source code belonging to a module is stored next to to the .build.cs file, or in subdirectories of it. Each .build.cs file declares a class deriving from the <a href="https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/release/Engine/Source/Programs/UnrealBuildTool/Configuration/ModuleRules.cs">ModuleRules</a> base class, and sets properties controlling how it should be built from its constructor. These .build.cs files are compiled by UnrealBuildTool and constructed to determine the overall compile environment.</p>
<p>The typical structure for a .build.cs file is as follows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Csharp">using UnrealBuildTool;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class PatrolCore : ModuleRules
{
    public PatrolCore(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
    {
        // Settings go here
    }
}

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>PCHUsage</strong> What type of PCH to use for this module</p>
<ul>
<li>Default: Engine modules use shared PCHs, game modules do not</li>
<li>NoPCHs: Never use any PCHs.</li>
<li>NoSharedPCHs: Never use shared PCHs.  Always generate a unique PCH for this module if appropriate</li>
<li>UseSharedPCHs: Shared PCHs are OK!</li>
<li>UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs: Shared PCHs may be used if an explicit private PCH is not set through PrivatePCHHeaderFile. In either case, none of the source files manually include a module PCH, and should include a matching header instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IWYUSupport</strong> what extent a module supports include-what-you-use</p>
<ul>
<li>None: code does not even compile. IWYU needs to skip this module entirely.</li>
<li>KeepAsIs: Module could be modified with iwyu but we want it to stay the way it is and handle changes manually.</li>
<li>KeepAsIsForNow: Module is parsed and processed. This means that from the outside it is stripped for includes even though the files are not modified. This can be used to defer iwyu work on a module. When it comes to transitive includes this module is seen as modified from the outside.</li>
<li>KeepPublicAsIsForNow: Same as KeepAsIsForNow but will allow iwyu to update private headers and cpp files.</li>
<li>Full: Full iwyu support. When running with -Mode=IWYU this module will be modified if needed</li>

<p>Every module necessitates, at minimum, a module definition, typically found in a source file bearing the same name as the module. This module definition help Unreal know how to handle our module when it loads and unloads it. To commence, we'll add a public header named &quot;{projectname}{modulename}.h&quot;. Additionally, we should create a corresponding &quot;{projectname}{modulename}.cpp&quot; file. Here, we register our module implementation as the primary module for our game. Each project mandates precisely one module designated as the primary game module. This primary module functions as the entry point for the project. Upon loading your project, the engine initiates by loading this primary module, which in turn initializes other modules and components as necessary. This systematic approach ensures a clear starting point for loading and running your project. By designating a primary module, Unreal adeptly manages dependencies. Other modules and parts of the game can count on the main module to load first. This helps keep everything organized and makes it easier to manage how different parts of the game depend on each other. While it might appear more adaptable to permit specifying regular modules without a primary module, such an approach could introduce ambiguity and complicate dependency management and project initialization. Requiring a primary module encourages best practices in project organization and contributes to the seamless execution of projects within Unreal.</p>

<p>That's it for the setup of our project, in the <a href="./building_unreal_project_from_scratch.html">next section</a> we will discuss how we can build our Unreal Project. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="build-an-unreal-project-from-scratch"><a class="header" href="#build-an-unreal-project-from-scratch">Build an Unreal Project from Scratch</a></h1>
<p>Now that we have an entry point to our project by setting up our primary module we have a project that is ready to be build from Source. We have done all this without the usage of Visual Studio or Unreal Editor, not because they are bad tools but just because this gives us a chance to see what's happening under the hood. Unreal uses the Visual C++ compiler and linker and it recommends Visual Studio as an officially supported IDE, but it does not actually use Microsoft's build system. Instead Unreal has it's own cross-platform build system, which is why we need to write those C# files to configure our target and its modules. When you generate Visual Studio project files, those solution and project files aren't actually an essential part of the build. They're just Visual Studio compatible frontend for Unreal's build process. If we navigate to <code>{UE-Install-Directory}/Engine/Build/BatchFiles</code> directory we can see a file called Build.bat. This just calls UnrealBuildTool.exe, which invokes builds. When you build your project in Visual Studio, it's essentially just running this Batch file. </p>
<p><img src="./resources/new-project-vs-frontend.png" alt="Running UBT" /></p>
<p>This batch file has 4 essential steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Setting up the environment</strong> It checks if the batch file exists in the expected directory and sets up the environment for the build process.</li>
<li><strong>Building the UnrealBuildTool</strong> It verifies the presence of the UnrealBuildTool and compiles it if necessary, either using Visual Studio or dotnet, depending on the context.</li>
<li><strong>Running the UnrealBuildTool</strong> It executes UnrealBuildTool with the provided arguments, which typically include the game name, platform name, configuration name, and any additional arguments required for the build process.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling</strong> It includes error handling mechanisms to detect and report errors that may occur during the build process, such as missing dependencies, compilation failures, or missing files.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unreal-build-tool"><a class="header" href="#unreal-build-tool">Unreal Build Tool</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>Unreal Build Tool</strong> (UBT) is a crucial component of the Unreal Engine, managing the process of building Unreal source code across a variety of build configurations. The Unreal Engine supports a wide range of platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, consoles like PlayStation and Xbox, and VR/AR devices. UBT plays a central role in managing the complexities of building projects for these diverse platforms, abstracting away much of the platform-specific details and providing a unified build system. Its primary responsibility lies in compiling, linking, and managing the code and assets integral to Unreal Engine projects. As we already discussed Unreal is split into many modules. Each module has a .build.cs file that controls how it is built, including options for defining module dependencies, additional libraries, include paths, etc. By default, these modules are compiled into DLLs and loaded by a single executable (You can also choose to build a monolithic executable in the BuildConfiguration.cs file). Understanding UBT and its role within the Unreal Engine ecosystem is essential for developers working with the platform. It empowers developers to effectively manage the intricacies of building Unreal projects, facilitating efficient development workflows and optimized project outcomes. Mastery of UBT not only enhances technical proficiency but also underscores foundational principles in software engineering and project management. Anyway, an entire article could be written about UBT. For more information about UBT I would like to advise you to read the <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/BuildTools/UnrealBuildTool/">Official Documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="using-ubt"><a class="header" href="#using-ubt">Using UBT</a></h2>
<p>We've already established that we don't require Visual Studio to build our project, we can still leave Visual Studio out of the equation when it comes to building our project while still making use of UBT. All we have to do is invoke Build.bat and pass in a few arguments. We need to tell it which Target we want to build, then we need to give it a platform and a build configuration. Then we just pass in the path to the .uproject file, and we can kick off the build. </p>
<ul>
<li>Open your terminal
<ul>
<li>CTRL + Tilde (~)</li>
<li>Type <code>{UE-BatchFiles}/Build.bat</code>
<ul>
<li><code>I:\Epic Games Unreal Engine\UE_5.3\Engine\Build\BatchFiles\Build.bat</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define a Target that you would like to build
<ul>
<li><code>{projectname}Editor</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define a Platform that would like to build for
<ul>
<li><code>Win64</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define a build configuration
<ul>
<li><code>Development</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define a path to the .uproject</li>
<li>Define <code>-waitMutex</code> and <code>-NoHotReload</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The full command should look like this: </p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">{UE-BatchFiles}/Build.bat PatrolEditor Win64 Development “{project_path}/Patrol.uproject&quot; -waitMutex -NoHotReload
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: if your path towards the batch file contains spaces encapsulate it with (“) and start your command with a “&amp;“</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">&amp; &quot;{UE-BatchFiles}/Build.bat&quot; PatrolEditor Win64 Development “{project_path}/Patrol.uproject&quot; -waitMutex -NoHotReload
</code></pre>
<p>A limitation of the UnrealBuildTool is that it can only build 1 project at a time, so we pass in <code>waitMutex</code> to make sure if there is an exception thrown when multiple builds have been started at the same time. Additionally, we are not going to be concerned with hot reloading our code when developing our project so lets specify <code>NoHotReload</code> as well.</p>
<p>Once the build gets going, we start getting build artifacts in the Intermediate directory. Eventually, Unreal Header Tool parses our source and spits out generated source files, then everything gets compiled to object code, and then finally our module is linked together into a DLL that the editor can load. We can see that DLL in the Binaries directory this file contains all the code we've written in our {modulename}Core module, in a compiled binary form. Next to that is the corresponding PDB, or symbol file this essentially contains debugging information so that symbols in the compiled binary version of our code can be traced back to the corresponding functions, variables, and other identifiers in the source code. We also get a .modules file, which is just a bit of metadata telling the editor which DLLs should be loaded for this module, and which Engine version those DLLs were compiled against this is why you'll get an error if you build editor binaries on one version of Unreal, then try to open them with a different version. There's also a .target file, which is just more metadata spit out by the build system which is not important for us.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up-2"><a class="header" href="#wrap-up-2">Wrap up</a></h2>
<p>That's it for the builing our project, in the <a href="./opening_unreal_project_from_scratch.html">next section</a> everything will come togheter, and we will start opening our project in Editor, Editor Standalone and Running our game. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="open-an-unreal-project-from-scratch"><a class="header" href="#open-an-unreal-project-from-scratch">Open an Unreal Project from Scratch</a></h1>
<p>We've pieced together our project using the .uproject file and Target Rule Definitions. We've got our entry point sorted by making use of the primary module and declared the dependencies within Module Build Rules. After all that, we've asked UBT to build our project and conjured up a DLL that the editor can load. Now we can let the Designers, Artists, and fellow Developers loose to tinker, tweak, and test-drive our creation.</p>
<h2 id="open-in-editor"><a class="header" href="#open-in-editor">Open in Editor</a></h2>
<p>To open your project: </p>
<ul>
<li>Run ${Unreal-Install-Dir}/Engine/Binaries/Win64/UnrealEditor.exe</li>
<li>Define the path to your .uproject</li>
<li>Define -log</li>
</ul>
<p>The full command should look like this: </p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">{UE-Bin}/UnrealEditor.exe “{project_path}/Patrol.uproject&quot; -log
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: if your path towards the batch file contains spaces encapsulate it with (“) and start your command with a “&amp;“</em></p>
<p>Since this is our first time booting up the project, we can see the Editor writing out some new files in our project directory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Saved</strong> contains logs and other files created at runtime, either by the game or the editor</li>
<li><strong>Derived Data Cache</strong> where the editor can cache data that it has built for specfic assets</li>
<li><strong>Content</strong> which maps directly to our project's assets in the Content Browser</li>
<li><strong>Config</strong> project configuration changes have been stored in .ini files</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="derived-data-cache"><a class="header" href="#derived-data-cache">Derived Data Cache</a></h3>
<p>Small word about Derived Data Cache (DDC) folder, Many Unreal Engine Assets require additional &quot;derived data&quot; before they can be used. (A simple example would be a Material that has a shader). Before the Material can be rendered, the shader must be compiled for the platform the editor is running on. Because the derived data is large, and at times may need regenerating, it is not checked into source control. Instead it's kept in the Derived Data Cache (DDC). Depending on how your project and system are configured, there can be several DDC caches in a hierarchy that ranges from fast to slow. When assessing derived data, your system will do the following to determine how quickly it can access it:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a piece of derived data is needed, the fastest cache is checked first, then the next fastest, and so on, until the data is found.</li>
<li>When the data is found, it is copied into the fastest local cache so that it is quicker to access next time.</li>
<li>If the data is not found, then it is first generated, then asynchronously copied into the caches so it is available for you (and potentially your team) in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Content stored in the DDC is disposable, and can be regenerated at any time using the data stored in the .uasset file. Storing these derived formats externally makes it possible to easily add or change the formats used by the engine without needing to modify the source Asset file.</p>
<p>For more information about DDC please visit the <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/derived-data-cache/">Official Documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="altering-our-project"><a class="header" href="#altering-our-project">Altering our project</a></h3>
<p>As we get ready to showcase our project, I'm going to shake things up a bit and tweak the defaults to give it some extra flavor. When we fire up the &quot;Standalone Editor&quot; and &quot;Standalone Game&quot; for testing, we'll be making sure our special map and engine settings are all loaded up correctly. To view the changes I made please navigate to the following <a href="./altering_the_project.html">page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="open-in-standalone-editor"><a class="header" href="#open-in-standalone-editor">Open in Standalone Editor</a></h2>
<p>Opening the Editor is cool, but as a developer we might not always need full control of the Editor this is why we can specify the <code>-game</code> flag to the previously defined command mentioned in the &quot;Open in Editor&quot; section. Like any program the Unreal Editor accepts different types of command-line arguments. When passing it different arguments the application (in this case the Unreal Editor) will react differently. Previously we only mentioned the command-line argument <code>-log</code> to display a log window while the application is running. When we specify the <code>-game</code> flag we ask the Editor to launch itself as a game client instead of the full application. </p>
<p>Several useful commands to remember when running in Standalone mode are as followed:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Command</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>-log</strong></td><td>Flag</td><td>Display a log window while the client or server is running.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>-game</strong></td><td>Flag</td><td>Mode flag to launch game client.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>-windowed</strong></td><td>Flag</td><td>Launch the client in windowed mode. Use in conjunction with -ResX=&lt;HORIZONTAL_RES&gt; -ResY=&lt;VERTICAL_RES&gt;.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>-fullscreen</strong></td><td>Flag</td><td>Launch the client in full-screen mode.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>-ResX=&lt;HORIZONTAL_RES&gt; -ResY=&lt;VERTICAL_RES&gt;</strong></td><td>Key-Value Pair</td><td>Specify the horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) resolution size for a client. Example: -ResX=1920 -ResY=1080</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>To run our the editor as a single game client we run the following command: </p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">{UE-Bin}/UnrealEditor.exe “{project_path}/Patrol.uproject&quot; -log -game -ResX=1280 -ResY=720
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: if your path towards the batch file contains spaces encapsulate it with (“) and start your command with a “&amp;“</em></p>
<p><img src="./resources/run-standalone-editor.png" alt="Run Standalone Editor" /></p>
<p>This is a fully playable instance of our game. We can fly around and we can use console commands as this is still a development build. This results in a quick way to test out the game in a development setting running from editor binaries. Because we are running from editor binaries we need this full installation of Unreal Engine in order to run the build. When we want to ship our game and avoid people having to install the entire Engine we need a standalone version of our project, that's what our non-editor target is for, in the <a href="./running_a_game.html">next section</a> we will demonstrate how we can run our game without the Editor attached. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="running-a-game"><a class="header" href="#running-a-game">Running a Game</a></h1>
<p>In the <a href="./opening_unreal_project_from_scratch.html">previous section</a> we learned how we are able to quickly iterate over our game in a development setting, running from editor binaries. But once your game is complete, you can package a release version for distribution. Before an Unreal project can be distributed to users, it must be properly packaged. Packaging ensures that all code and content is up to date and in the proper format to run on the desired target platform.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-game"><a class="header" href="#building-a-game">Building a Game</a></h2>
<p>All we must do to run a standalone game is invoke the same build process, passing in our project's Game target instead of its Editor target. This'll run through the same build process, but instead of linking our individual modules into DLL files, it'll link our project against all the required Engine code and generate a single executable that runs our game, with all the editor-specific functionality stripped out. </p>

<h2 id="cooking-content"><a class="header" href="#cooking-content">Cooking Content</a></h2>
<p>Before running our executable, we must first take the essential step of preparing our content also known as &quot;cooking&quot;. In the realm of Unreal, content assets are stored in specific internal formats, such as PNG for textures and WAV for audio. However, this content needs to be converted to different formats for the various platforms, either because the platform uses a proprietary format, does not support the format Unreal uses to store the asset, or a more memory- or performance-effective format exists.</p>
<p>This conversion process, known as &quot;cooking,&quot; is crucial for the seamless integration of content into the final game. We can start this process either through command-line operations or by utilizing in-editor tools. It's important to note that, for some platforms, all content must undergo the cooking process before it can be used on the device to ensure proper functionality. You should verify with the specifications of the platform they are targeting to ensure compliance with these requirements.</p>
<p>There are two ways to cook content for your projects</p>
<ul>
<li>by the book </li>
<li>on the fly</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./resources/unreal-cooking-manner.png" alt="How would you like to cook" /></p>
<h3 id="by-the-book"><a class="header" href="#by-the-book">By the Book</a></h3>
<p>Cook by the book performs the entirety of the cook process ahead of time allowing for the build to deploy the cooked assets all at once rather than as needed while playing the level (if you were using a cook server). This option is useful for developers who are not iterating on individual assets or for those who want the game to perform at full-speed without waiting for a server to deliver the necessary cooked content. Typically, performance testing and playtests will want to use this method.</p>
<p>When performing a cook by the book, there is no extra setup required for the build.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-fly"><a class="header" href="#on-the-fly">On the Fly</a></h3>
<p>When you choose to cook content on the fly (COTF), it will delay cooking it until after the game has been deployed to the platform. Only the executable and some other basic files are installed, which use network communication with a Cook Server to make requests on-demand as the content is needed. COTF allows for faster iteration for developers who will be making changes to content regularly or those who will only be exploring sections of the game.</p>
<p>To cook on the fly, you will first need to start a Cook Server on a machine which has the full project available to it. This can be either your local machine or a remote server which performs the cook.</p>
<p>Cooking on the fly is specified with the command-line argument: <code>-cookonthefly</code>. This launches a server which waits for a game to connect and then serves the cooked data as needed. Requires <code>-filehostip=&lt;Server IP&gt;</code> on the game's command line to connect with the server.</p>
<p>For more information on how to cook on the fly please visit the <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/SharingAndReleasing/Deployment/BuildOperations/">Official Documentation</a></p>
<h3 id="cooking-our-content"><a class="header" href="#cooking-our-content">Cooking our Content</a></h3>
<p>Given that we've already executed our entire pipeline via the command line, it's sensible to continue with the cooking process using the same method. We will cook our content <code>By the book</code> as we don't have or own a server to hook up.</p>

</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: if your path towards the batch file contains spaces encapsulate it with (“) and start your command with a “&amp;“</em></p>
<p>Other command-line arguments for the cooking process are as followed:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>iterate</strong></td><td>Specifies the cooker only cook items that are out of date. Without this option, the sandbox directory is deleted and everything is recooked.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Map</strong></td><td>Specifies the map(s) to build.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>MapIniSection</strong></td><td>Specifies a section from the ini files which contains map names. Cooker will cook all maps specified in the section specified.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>UnVersioned</strong></td><td>Saves all of the cooked packages without versions. These are then assumed to be the current version on load.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>CookAll</strong></td><td>Cooks everything.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Compressed</strong></td><td>Tells the cooker to compress the cooked packages.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>After our content is cooked, we end up with a Saved/Cooked directory. This is where our standalone game exectuable will find all the assets it needs to load at runtime</p>
<p><img src="./resources/unreal-cooked-assests-location.png" alt="Cooked Assets" /></p>
<p>Now we can run our game this should be functionally the same as running from editor binaries, except we're now using cooked data loaded straight from disk the engine isn't building any assets on demand at runtime. We've still built in the Development configuration, though, so we have access to all the same developer tools.</p>

<p>So sure, we don't need to use Visual Studio to build and run our project. That's cool and all but having to invoke this batch file with these specific arguments is kind of a pain in the a**. In the <a href="./quality_of_life_improvements.html">next section</a> we will introduce some quality of life improvements to prevent this.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="quality-of-life"><a class="header" href="#quality-of-life">Quality of Life</a></h1>
<p>In the <a href="./running_a_game.html">previous section</a> we noticed that there are a lot of commands we have to enter in order to work with Unreal from the command line. This however will only slow us down rather than improve iteration speed. Luckily, we as developers can remedy this by introducing a quick fix and make our own batch files that invoke these commands. I will not bore you with writing these files yourself as we did with the snippets for VS Code you can download a script from <a href="https://github.com/Dyronix/unreal-generation">this GitHub repository</a> that will setup these files for you. I know batch files aren't really the state of the art in build automation, but we're not doing anything fancy here, so this approach works fine. Feel free to upgrade it to your liking.</p>

<p>What's great about using the command-line is that we can easily chain multiple commands together. If we run <code>build_editor &amp;&amp; run_editor</code>, that will build and if and only if the build succeeds, it'll launch the editor. This lets us jump quickly back and forth between code and editor.</p>
<h2 id="vs-code-tasks"><a class="header" href="#vs-code-tasks">VS Code Tasks</a></h2>
<p>An extension that was installed in the <a href="./development_setup.html">development setup</a> chapter was called VS Code Tasks. Now that the batch files have been created we can setup these tasks. You see you can specify certain commands within VS Code without using the terminal. It's like having the &quot;Run&quot; button of Visual Studio but better.</p>
<p><img src="./resources/vs-code-tasks.png" alt="VS Code Tasks" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Create .vscode folder in your {project_directory}</li>
<li>Add a <code>tasks.json</code> file to this folder</li>
<li>Fill the contents of this file with commands you would like to execute</li>
<li>Created tasks will end up at the bottom of the IDE</li>

<h2 id="the-iteration-loop"><a class="header" href="#the-iteration-loop">The iteration loop</a></h2>
<p>When we would like to test a feature there is a simple iteration loop we can run to speed up our development cycle. A fast and efficient development iteration cycle holds immense value for software development teams across various industries. One of its primary advantages lies in providing a faster feedback loop. By shortening the time between development, testing, and implementation, teams can swiftly identify any issues, bugs, or inefficiencies in their code or features. This rapid feedback loop enables developers to make necessary improvements promptly, leading to higher-quality software products.</p>
<p>Moreover, an accelerated iteration cycle enhances the agility of development teams. In today's rapidly evolving technology landscape, the ability to quickly test and implement new features is essential for staying competitive. A fast iteration cycle allows teams to respond promptly to market demands, user feedback, and changing requirements. This agility enables companies to adapt their products swiftly, ensuring they remain relevant and meet the evolving needs of their users.</p>
<p>Shortening the development cycle also translates to reduced time to market. By delivering features and updates more rapidly, companies can gain a significant advantage over their competitors. Being able to introduce new features quickly can lead to increased market share, revenue, and customer satisfaction. Additionally, a rapid iteration cycle allows companies to capitalize on opportunities swiftly and respond effectively to competitive threats.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a fast iteration cycle fosters enhanced collaboration within development teams and across departments. By continuously integrating and testing new features, teams can identify potential conflicts, dependencies, or areas for improvement early in the development process. This collaborative approach promotes a culture of shared ownership and collective responsibility for the success of the product. It encourages cross-functional collaboration between developers, testers, designers, and other stakeholders, leading to more cohesive and well-rounded software solutions.</p>
<p>Finally, a fast and efficient iteration cycle cultivates a culture of continuous improvement. By regularly releasing updates and gathering feedback from users, teams can iteratively enhance and optimize their products based on real-world usage and data. This iterative approach enables teams to make incremental improvements over time, ensuring that the product evolves and remains competitive in the market. Ultimately, a fast iteration cycle is essential for accelerating innovation, improving product quality, and driving business success in today's dynamic and competitive environment.</p>

<h2 id="testing-our-code"><a class="header" href="#testing-our-code">Testing our code</a></h2>
<p>To ensure the effectiveness of our code, we should test it. We'll accomplish this by opening the Editor and placing an instance of our <code>AActor</code> within the scene. This step allows us to validate the functionality of our <code>AActor</code> implementation in a real-world environment.</p>
<p><img src="./resources/unreal-place-actor-in-scene.png" alt="Placing an Actor within the Scene" /></p>
<p>Once the <code>AActor</code> is positioned within the scene, adjustments to its predefined properties can be made. Subsequently, initiating gameplay by pressing the play button enables close monitoring of the output window. Here, a logging functionality has been integrated within the code to present information regarding the <code>AActor</code>, encompassing its name and the property value.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
<p>PS: I've added some additional work-flow tools that I had not idea where to put in the appendix section, or you could just click <a href="./additional_workflow_items.html">here</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="altering-our-project-1"><a class="header" href="#altering-our-project-1">Altering our project</a></h1>
<p>As we get ready to showcase our project, I'm going to shake things up a bit and tweak the defaults to give it some extra flavor. When we fire up the &quot;Standalone Editor&quot; and &quot;Standalone Game&quot; for testing, we'll be making sure our special map and engine settings are all loaded up correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>First let us alter the maps atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./resources/altering-the-atmosphere.png" alt="Altering the atmosphere" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Save the map in the Content Browser</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./resources/altering-save-to-content-browser.png" alt="Save to the Content Browser" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Generate a unique project ID</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./resources/altering-unique-project-id.png" alt="Generate a unique ID" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Setup target hardware</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./resources/altering-setup-target-hardware.png" alt="Setup target hardware" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Change the default map to our new map we just saved</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./resources/altering-change-default-map.png" alt="Change default map" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="additional-workflow-items"><a class="header" href="#additional-workflow-items">Additional Workflow Items</a></h1>
<h2 id="looking-for-files"><a class="header" href="#looking-for-files">Looking for files</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>If you hit Ctrl+P, you can quickly browse to any file that's been included in the project.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./resources/workflow-looking-for-files.png" alt="Looking for files" /></p>
<h2 id="creating-a-code-workspace"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-code-workspace">Creating a Code workspace</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>You can add ${unreal}/Source/Runtime directory to your project workspace so you have the Unreal source code at your fingertips.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we add UE's ${unreal}/Engine/Source/Runtime directory, then we'll also have the Engine source at our fingertips. The key distinction here is that where Visual Studio tries to be smart, VS Code just tries to be fast. With Visual Studio, you're dealing with IntelliSense, which has to parse the entire Engine codebase and run extensive static analysis, and then it has to reason about that codebase while working around the fact that huge chunks of it rely on a custom code generation process... and if you ask me, expecting it to be reliably correct and responsive is just too much to ask. Back when I was using Visual Studio, I found I couldn't rely on IntelliSense, and I'd end up just searching through the API documentation all the time. But the code itself contains the exact same documentation you can cut out the middle-man and Ctrl+P your way straight to an answer, faster than it takes for an IntelliSense completion window to appear. This approach keeps you in the driver's seat.</p>

<h2 id="looking-for-symbols"><a class="header" href="#looking-for-symbols">Looking for symbols</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Use CTRL + SHIFT + F to search the entire codebase to see how a symbol is used or referenced</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./resources/workflow-looking-for-symbols.png" alt="Looking for symbols" /></p>
<h2 id="plugin-directory"><a class="header" href="#plugin-directory">Plugin directory</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the ${unreal}/Engine/Plugins directory as a reference on how to structure Unreal modules within your project</li>
</ul>
<p>A good source of example code is the Engine Plugins directory. If we limit our search there, we can find usage examples that are set up in the same way our project code should be.</p>
<p><img src="./resources/workflow-plugin-directory.png" alt="Plugin directory" /></p>
<h2 id="documentation"><a class="header" href="#documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the Engine Source Code as documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>I've found that if you treat the Engine source as documentation in and of itself, and if you optimize your workflow for browsing that source, you'll gain a much more intuitive understanding of it over time.</p>
